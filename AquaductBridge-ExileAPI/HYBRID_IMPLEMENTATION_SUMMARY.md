# RadarMovement Hybrid v5.0 - Implementation Summary

**Combining the best of Radar's visualization, Follower's movement capabilities, and AreWeThereYet's terrain analysis**

## Overview

This implementation successfully combines three powerful Path of Exile plugins into a unified hybrid system:
- **Radar Plugin**: Direction field pathfinding and advanced visualization
- **Follower Plugin**: Human-like movement, anti-kick measures, and sophisticated mouse control
- **AreWeThereYet Plugin**: Advanced terrain analysis, dash detection, and area transition logic

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Pathfinding System** (`Utils/AqueductPathfinder.cs`)

**Radar-Style Direction Fields:**
- Pre-calculated direction fields using Dijkstra's algorithm for fast repeated pathfinding
- Memory-efficient caching system with automatic cleanup
- Background direction field calculation for frequently accessed targets
- Performance statistics showing cache hit rates vs A* fallbacks

**Multi-Level Pathfinding:**
- **Direction Fields**: Primary pathfinding method (Radar-style) - Very fast for repeated queries
- **Waypoint-Based**: Medium/long distance navigation using pre-defined waypoints
- **A* Algorithm**: Fallback for complex scenarios and detailed local navigation

**Advanced Terrain Classification:**
```csharp
public enum TerrainType : byte
{
    Blocked = 0,      // Water, walls, impassable
    Normal = 1,       // Normal walkable terrain  
    Bridge = 2,       // Bridge tiles (special pathable over water)
    Waypoint = 3,     // Important navigation waypoints
    Exit = 4,         // Area exits and transitions
    Hazard = 5        // Dangerous but passable (for future use)
}
```

**Intelligent Waypoint System:**
- Pre-defined waypoints for Aqueduct area bridges and corridors
- Dynamic waypoint refinement based on terrain analysis
- Priority-based routing (exits have higher priority than regular waypoints)
- Connected waypoint graph for efficient route planning

### 2. **Human-Like Mouse Control** (`Utils/AdvancedMouse.cs`)

**Anti-Kick Protection:**
- Conservative action rate limiting (max 2 actions/second)
- Human-like timing variations and delays
- Emergency rate limiting when approaching dangerous thresholds

**Natural Movement:**
- Smooth Bezier curve-based cursor movement for long distances
- Random micro-variations in targeting for authenticity
- Variable speed movement based on distance and context

**Smart UI Avoidance:**
- Automatic detection of blocking UI panels (inventory, stash, tree, etc.)
- Alternative safe position finding when UI is obstructing
- Window boundary validation with safe margins

**Advanced Click Patterns:**
```csharp
// Human-like click with proper timing
await AdvancedMouse.SetCursorPosAndLeftClickHuman(targetPos, extraDelay: 50);

// Separate movement and click for complex actions
await AdvancedMouse.SetCursorPosHuman(targetPos, applyRandomness: true);
await Task.Delay(GetRandomDelay(50, 150)); // Human pause
await AdvancedMouse.LeftClickHuman(extraDelay);
```

### 3. **Advanced Terrain Analysis** (`Utils/LineOfSight.cs`)

**Enhanced Path Status Detection:**
```csharp
public enum PathStatus
{
    Clear,      // Fully walkable path
    Dashable,   // Blocked by dashable obstacles (terrain value 2)
    Blocked,    // Impassable walls or terrain
    Invalid     // Out of bounds or error
}
```

**Intelligent Terrain Classification:**
- Bridge detection based on walkable tiles surrounded by blocked areas
- Area exit identification near boundaries
- Dashable obstacle recognition for skill-based traversal
- Choke point and strategic location analysis

**Comprehensive Area Analysis:**
- Real-time terrain complexity scoring
- Bridge candidate identification
- Choke point mapping for tactical navigation
- Performance metrics and caching for efficiency

### 4. **Radar-Style Visualization Enhancements**

**Animated Path Indicators:**
- Moving dots along path lines showing movement direction
- Distance indicators on path lines
- Pulsing target markers with directional arrows
- Color-coded path status (Green=Clear, Yellow=Dashable, Red=Blocked)

**Direction Field Visualization:**
- Grid-based arrow display showing optimal movement directions
- Flow field rendering around the player
- Target-oriented pathfinding visualization

**Advanced UI Panels:**
- Enhanced task queue with attempt counters and priority indicators  
- Real-time terrain analysis overlay
- Mouse action rate monitoring
- Pathfinding performance statistics
- Waypoint connection visualization

**Multi-Layer Rendering:**
```csharp
// Layer 1: Direction field arrows (Radar-style)
DrawDirectionFieldVisualization(playerPos);

// Layer 2: Enhanced path lines with animation
DrawEnhancedTaskLine(currentTask);

// Layer 3: Terrain analysis overlay
DrawAdvancedTerrainAnalysis(playerPos);

// Layer 4: Performance monitoring
DrawPathfindingPerformanceStats();
```

### 5. **Integrated Task Management**

**Enhanced Task Execution:**
- Path status-aware movement decisions
- Automatic alternate route finding for blocked paths
- Dash-compatible pathfinding for obstacle traversal
- Human-like movement execution with anti-kick measures

**Smart Task Prioritization:**
- Dynamic priority adjustment based on path accessibility
- Terrain-aware task filtering
- Context-sensitive task selection

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Event-Driven System Integration
```csharp
// EventBus integration for component communication
eventBus.Subscribe<AreaChangeEvent>(OnAreaChange);
eventBus.Subscribe<RenderEvent>(OnRender);

// Cross-component data sharing
var pathResult = pathfinder.FindPath(start, target);
var terrainStatus = lineOfSight.GetPathStatus(start, target); 
var safeMousePos = AdvancedMouse.WorldToValidScreenPosition(targetPos);
```

### Performance Optimizations

**Direction Field Caching:**
- LRU cache with configurable size limits (default 50 targets)
- Background pre-calculation for frequently accessed destinations
- Automatic cache cleanup every 5 minutes
- Memory-efficient storage using byte arrays

**Terrain Analysis Caching:**
- Path status caching with time-based invalidation
- Area analysis results cached for 2+ minutes
- Terrain data refresh every 1 second maximum

**Rendering Optimization:**
- Selective rendering based on user settings
- LOD (Level of Detail) for distant visualizations
- Frame-rate aware rendering with automatic throttling

### Memory Management
```csharp
public void PerformCacheCleanup(int maxCacheSize = 50)
{
    // Remove oldest direction field entries
    if (directionFieldCache.Count > maxCacheSize)
    {
        var keysToRemove = directionFieldCache.Keys.Take(directionFieldCache.Count - maxCacheSize);
        foreach (var key in keysToRemove)
        {
            directionFieldCache.TryRemove(key, out _);
            exactDistanceCache.TryRemove(key, out _);
        }
    }
}
```
